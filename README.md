  Petster is an Android application designed to facilitate the connection between independent animal rescuers/volunteers and animal shelters. Within the app, volunteers can create detailed posts showcasing the animals they have rescued—ranging from strays found on the street to victims of accidents or neglect. Shelters, in turn, can actively browse and search through these volunteer postings to find animals that fit their intake capacity and specific needs. This system streamlines the process, making it easier for shelters to discover animals requiring placement and for volunteers' rescued animals to gain visibility and find a pathway into the formal adoption system. Built with [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).
